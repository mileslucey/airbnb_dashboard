## Background Information
### Team Members
* Shannon Chang
* Madeleine Merken
* Miles Lucey
### Data Source
* We are planning on using the MySQL database created in the ETL project: https://github.com/mileslucey/Seattle_AirBnB_ETL
## Proposal
* We are planning to create a visual dashboard with multiple charts that change depending on which of Seattle's neighborhoods are selected (Queen Anne, Ballard, Other neighborhoods, Cascade, Central Area, University District, Downtown	Magnolia, West Seattle, Interbay	Beacon Hill, Rainier Valley, Delridge, Seward Park, Northgate, Capitol Hill, Lake City). We want to create the following charts:
     1. A table showing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile and mean price, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms of listings, 
     2. Pie Charts showing percent if listings with specific number of bedrooms and numbers of bathrooms. Additional pie charts showing percent of listing of diffrent room types (e.g. room, entire house, etc), cancellation policy (moderate, strict, flexible, etc.)
               * https://plot.ly/javascript/pie-charts/
     3. A boxplot showing the distribution of review scores per listing
               * https://plot.ly/javascript/box-plots/
     4. A histogram showing the prices of the listings in the neighborhoods and another histogram showing the numbers of days of availability over the next year
               * https://plot.ly/javascript/histograms/
     5. Create wordclouds of the review comments for each neighborhood
