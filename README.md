# AirBnB Dashboard
## Background Information
### Team Members
* Shannon Chang
* Madeleine Merken
* Miles Lucey
### Data Source
* We are planning on using the MySQL database created in the ETL project: https://github.com/mileslucey/Seattle_AirBnB_ETL
## Proposal
* We are planning to create a visual dashboard with multiple charts. We want our project to have two pages showing the following:
1. Page One: Listing Information by Neighborhood
      * A toggle will be at the top of the page in which the user can select which Seattle neighborhood (Queen Anne, Ballard, Other neighborhoods, Cascade, Central Area, University District, Downtown	Magnolia, West Seattle, Interbay	Beacon Hill, Rainier Valley, Delridge, Seward Park, Northgate, Capitol Hill, Lake City) she/he wants to explore.
      * The following displays will be created (dependent on which neighborhood is selected):
          1. A table showing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile and mean price of listings
          2. 
2. Host Information Separating Hosts into Superhosts and Non Superhosts (Page 2)
