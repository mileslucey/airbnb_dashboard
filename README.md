# AirBnB Dashboard
## Background Information
### Team Members
* Shannon Chang
* Madeleine Merken
* Miles Lucey
### Data Source
* We are planning on using the MySQL database created in the ETL project: https://github.com/mileslucey/Seattle_AirBnB_ETL
## Proposal
* We are planning to create a visual dashboard with multiple charts. We want our project to have two pages showing the following:
1. Listing Information by Neighborhood. A toggle will be at the top of the page in which the user can select which Seattle neighborhood she/he wants to explore. (Page 1).
    * A table showing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile and mean price of listings  
2. Host Information Separating Hosts into Superhosts and Non Superhosts (Page 2)
